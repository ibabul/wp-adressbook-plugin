# What does this plugin do?

> This plugin developed for learning purpose. After the activation of the plugin, it creates a @Table to database to get the input from the customer. If the table already exist, that means if the admin user active this plugin for the second time he will not require creating a table again.

> Sanitize all the user input before passing them to the database. Once the data is submitted, it will show up in the address list page where all the input data will be shown.

> Address list page extends the WP_List_table class to create table and maintain the WordPress default design for table. Also, it is a sortable table with Date and Name(ASC).
